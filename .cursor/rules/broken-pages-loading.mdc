# Broken State: Pages Not Loading

**Last working:** `868b674` (tag: `last-working-868b674`) — "refactor: replace RecordModal with useRecordModal context across components"  
**First broken:** `6294cdd` — "refactor: replace RecordModal instances with global context usage"

All commits after 868b674 show Error or broken pages on Vercel.

## Symptoms
- Pages do not load
- Cannot click to navigate to another page
- No data displayed on pages

## Context
- Console shows `loadBlocks` called, API returns data, `setBlocks CHECK` runs
- Likely cause: blocks not being set/rendered, or navigation/overlay blocking clicks
- FieldSettingsDrawerHost refactor was initially suspected but that component is not used in the app

## To Fix
1. **Baseline:** `868b674` is the last known working state — use `git diff 868b674` to compare
2. Break introduced in `6294cdd` (RecordModal global context) — compare that commit's changes
3. Check InterfacePageClient loadBlocks/setBlocks flow and `willUpdate` in logs
4. **Overlays blocking navigation:** Full-screen overlays (`fixed inset-0`) must use `md:left-64` to exclude the sidebar so navigation links remain clickable. See `navigation-overlay-must-not-block-sidebar.mdc`
5. Verify RightSettingsPanelDataContext and related components
