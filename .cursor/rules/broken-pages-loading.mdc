# Broken State: Pages Not Loading

**Git tag:** `broken-pages-loading`  
**Commit:** 6b48b9bc01 — "refactor: streamline interface components and settings management"

## Symptoms
- Pages do not load
- Cannot click to navigate to another page
- No data displayed on pages

## Context
- Console shows `loadBlocks` called, API returns data, `setBlocks CHECK` runs
- Likely cause: blocks not being set/rendered, or navigation/overlay blocking clicks
- FieldSettingsDrawerHost refactor was initially suspected but that component is not used in the app

## To Fix
1. Compare against `git show broken-pages-loading` or `git diff broken-pages-loading`
2. Check InterfacePageClient loadBlocks/setBlocks flow and `willUpdate` in logs
3. Check for overlays (RightSettingsPanel, modals) blocking clicks
4. Verify RightSettingsPanelDataContext and related components
